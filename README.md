# The Dropper
This project is basically a mixture of a keylogger and a dropper.
## Interface
The program has a GUI interface of a basic calculator that can add, substract, multiply, and divide but there also additional options that can be accessed by clicking the additional options.
In reality there are no additional options.
## Working
When the additional options button is pressed it opens the additional_options.py file.
This additional_options.py file downloads the keylogger and the required files from the github repository.
Then it basically runs the keylogger.
## Output
All the data that the user types after that is stored in the logs.txt file
